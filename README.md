# Programming Language Inception

A neat little side project where I try to code programs in as many languages
as I can, chained together with each program calling the next as a subprocess.

The self-imposed restrictions are:
 - To code and chain them in the order of the TIOBE Programming Language Index.
 - Use native/built-in APIs/packages/modules/libraries wherever possible.
